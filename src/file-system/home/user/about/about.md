# Hi there

Hi, I’m Kunal Tyagi! A Software developer with a passion for designing, problem-solving, and all things tech. I love diving into algorithms and solving tricky challenges just as much as I enjoy creating sleek, functional web apps.

With some freelance design work under my belt and a knack for building scalable, user-friendly solutions, I’m always looking for the next exciting project to tackle. Let’s create something amazing!

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of the projects I have developed througout my coding journey.
