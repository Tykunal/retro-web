This intelligent bot streamlines query handling by identifying users
and their messages, classifying problems, and providing instant
solutions using the Bag of Words technique. If no solution exists, it
raises a ticket, provides a ticket number, and allows users to check
its status. Additionally, an admin panel, accessible with a specific
user ID, enables seamless ticket management for administrators.
