Most recently, during my semester break, I delved into the fascinating world of 3D modeling 
and explored the capabilities of Three.js. Leveraging this powerful library, I developed
interactive 3D elements and seamlessly integrated them into websites, enhancing
user engagement and visual appeal.
This experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of 3D graphics and their applications 
in modern web development.
